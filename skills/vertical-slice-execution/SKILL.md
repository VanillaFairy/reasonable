## Overview

This is the main-session decision plane, run **in the main session** (the runner can't block on a
human or launch another workflow). It drives one vertical slice — a user-visible scenario — to GREEN
end-to-end by **launching `workflows/frontier-wave.workflow.js`** and **routing the typed
`GATE_RESULT`** it returns. You no longer hand-interpret the dispatch loop: the runner is the pure
in-run plane (reconcile → route-planner → `groupDisjoint` → per-wave enrichment `pipeline()` → trap
`switch` → scribe), and the control flow there is a **script, never improvised** (§7, §8). Your job is
the membrane: launch, route the result, and do the things the runner cannot — block on the human,
launch nested workflows (spike/scaffold), merge lanes, and reconcile the journal.

## Mode behavior (gated vs autonomous)

Read `mode` from `.reasonable/config.json` (set by `reasonable:develop` / `reasonable:develop-autonomously`)
and pass it to the runner in `args.runMode`. Approval gates (the inbox, the **final effort→base merge**,
second budget extensions) behave by mode — **gated**: they **block** for an explicit human nod (*silence
never consents*); **autonomous**: decide, **log** to the ledger (`approvedBy:"autonomous"`), and proceed
without blocking. **Per-slice integration is not one of these gates:** a green lane auto-merges into the
**effort branch** every slice, automatically and logged, in *both* modes — branch hygiene never
escalates (§7). Only the single end-of-effort `effortBranch → baseBranch` merge is the human-integration
decision (§7a). The runner enforces this distinction inside its trap router; you enforce it at the
membrane crossings it hands back. In **both** modes the full enrichment pipeline (implement → blind
test → adjudicate → audit) and every mechanical gate check (discriminator, mutation sampling, sanity,
mapping) runs inside the runner — **the protocol is absolute**, never streamlined. A **vision
amendment** always routes to the human regardless of mode.

**Announce at start:** "Using vertical-slice-execution to drive vertical slice <id> to GREEN."

**Rigid skill — one TodoWrite item per numbered step; do not skip or reorder.**

**You are the single writer of *nothing* during the run** — the runner's lone serialized `journal-writer`
scribe owns the derived index (`journal.json` + `inbox.json`) while the run is in flight. You write the
journal only at the membrane: before launch (slice opening) and after the run returns (merges, slice
closing). Inside the run, you reconcile and read; you never co-write the index.

(`${reasonable}` in the commands below = this plugin's root directory — `$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` in
hooks; substitute the installed absolute path when you invoke a script.)

## Progress visibility (the live tree, D19)

A long run dispatches dozens of agents over many minutes — so progress must be *visible* without
spamming the chat. The plugin maintains a **deterministic nested progress tree** at
`.reasonable/progress.md` (and structured `progress.json`): effort → vertical slice → work order →
atomic action, with agents/tokens since the effort began. It is regenerated **with no model in the
loop** by a hook on every journal write (zero tokens), so it is always exactly consistent with the
ledger.

- **Tell the human ONCE** (the first vertical slice of the effort), in your own voice, to **pin
  `.reasonable/progress.md`** to follow the run live. Later updates are silent — the file just grows.
- Keep the main-session **TodoWrite at the vertical-slice grain** — one item per frontier slice, the
  active one `in_progress` — *not* a single opaque "run" item. The within-slice detail (work orders,
  stages, atomic actions, cost) lives in the mirror, never the todo.
- When the runner returns a `GATE_RESULT`, post a **concise** boundary digest (1–3 lines: slice +
  what's done / doing / cost) — read it from `node ${reasonable}/lib/progress.mjs --root <effortRoot>`
  or the result evidence. Never paste the whole tree into chat; point to the pinned mirror.

## 0. Open the vertical slice
- Confirm exactly **one vertical slice in flight** (the default; cross-vertical-slice parallelism is opt-in, see §6).
- **Promote** the vertical slice's gate just-in-time (remove the ignore marker). Run the suite; confirm the
  gate is **RED** (open) and everything else is green. A gate that's already green pins nothing —
  investigate before proceeding.
- Record the slice opening in the journal (the last write you own before the run takes over the index).

## 1. Launch the frontier-wave workflow
- **Mark the slice dispatched before the launch call.** The slice node was planted `pending` at
  ratification (analysis step 10a, or a retro route re-sort) — flip it active now, so the tree shows
  work in flight the instant the run starts, not after it returns:
  `node ${reasonable}/lib/ledger.mjs append --root <effortRoot> --type node-dispatched --node <S> --kind slice`
- Launch it **by name** — `Workflow({ name: 'frontier-wave', args: {...} })` — not by
  `scriptPath`. The registered-name path passes `args` reliably; **`scriptPath` drops `args`** (the
  run then sees an empty `args` global). Pass `args`: `effortRoot` (the main checkout, native path),
  `verticalSliceId`, the `route` snapshot, the contract paths, the per-slice `budget.total`, the
  supervision `profile`, `runMode`, the slice's **effective `tier`** (`slice.tier ?? config.tier`;
  default `full` — see the ratchet bullet below), the **branch pair** (`effortBranch`, `baseBranch` — so the
  provisioner cuts lanes from the effort branch; the reconcile prologue also recovers them from
  `config.json` if omitted), and the brownfield flags (`brownfield`, `lowFloor`). Pass `args`
  as an actual JSON object, never a stringified one. The Workflow call returns **immediately** with a
  run id; the run executes in the background and notifies you on completion.
- **Resolve the slice's effective tier — raise-only.** Tier is two-level: `config.tier` is the effort
  default and a `route.md` slice may carry its own `tier`; the effective tier is `slice.tier ??
  config.tier` (absent → `full`). A **human** may set any slice to any tier, but you (an agent) may only
  ever *raise* a slice to `full` (the safe direction) — never silently lower it to `lite`. `lite` drops
  **only** the audit's iterative mutation-sample inside the runner (the §17 audit-depth collapse); every
  other check and guard runs identically, and it composes freely with either run mode. Pass the resolved
  value as `args.tier`.
- **Args-drop fallback (D18):** even if `args` arrives empty, the runner's reconcile prologue
  recovers `effortRoot` and the open slice from its own cwd (the effort root) and threads them back,
  so a run still proceeds; it only HALTs (asking you to relaunch by name) when the root cannot be
  recovered at all. Prefer launching by name so the fallback never has to fire.
- **The runner is the loop — do not re-implement it.** Inside, deterministically and per the spec: it
  runs the reconcile prologue (HALT on AMBIGUOUS), dispatches the `route-planner` (footprints +
  resources + trust-staleness), packs work orders into disjoint waves via pure set-algebra
  (`groupDisjoint`, mirroring `lib/footprint.mjs` `independent()`), and per wave runs the enrichment
  `pipeline()`. Trust the typed return; verify evidence at §5/§7, never by re-running the wave logic
  yourself.
- **Crash recovery:** if the run dies mid-flight, relaunch with `{scriptPath, resumeFromRunId}` in the
  **same session** (the longest unchanged `agent()` prefix replays from cache). A cold restart cannot
  replay — re-launch fresh; the runner's reconcile prologue re-derives truth from git + ledger +
  contracts (no truth is lost; the derived index is rebuilt).

## 2. The enrichment pipeline (what the runner realizes — do not run it by hand)
The runner sequences this per contract, in the one order that closes three rot vectors. The naive
`implement → update contract → update tests → make green → audit` rots; this order doesn't. You do not
drive these stages — you read this so you can interpret the `GATE_RESULT` and the ledger:

1. **Provision + implement.** The `lane-provisioner` creates the worktree + `.reasonable-lane.json` +
   journal record *before* the fenced worker (closes the descriptor-less window). The `implementer`
   then builds thin-real on path, loud stubs off path, **writes its own contract enrichment + ledger
   line in its one atomic commit**, and emits an `OUTCOME` (reporting its enrichment in
   `detail.enrichment`). On a brownfield first touch the runner folds in the in-run `characterizer`
   genesis (provider-first, after the implementer's `behaviorDelta`) — an **agent sequence, never a
   nested `workflow()`** (one-level nesting forbids it).
2. **Intent-verify the enrichment** (the contract-enrichment adversary — closes rot guard 3
   *pre-integration*). Because the implementer writes its own contract fresh from the code, a
   *sycophantic* enrichment — one that restates what the code does rather than what the spec demands —
   would pass any tests-vs-contract audit with honors; only **intent-level** review against the top
   edge catches it. So before the blind-test-writer derives tests from the diff, a fresh-context,
   read-only `intent-verifier` judges the **proposed** enrichment against the **vision + vertical-slice
   spec** (the oracle *above* the artifact — never `intention.md`, never the contract the implementer
   wrote, which would be circular). It is **risk-gated** (D7): the runner **always** runs it when the
   enrichment touches a **shared contract** (a citation to a neighbour); it may skip a boxed-in
   own-contract-only delta. The adversary **proposes** `accept | reject | escalate` and acts on nothing
   (Law-3 corollary) — a narrow writer appends the `verifier-verdict` ledger event on accept; **reject**
   routes back to the implementer for one bounded re-enrichment (still-rejected → `intent-fork`);
   **escalate** → the human inbox (autonomous: joins the always-escalate classes). This is **not** a
   `behaviorDelta`-completeness verifier — that would be a *false trio*: an undeclared move surfaces
   mechanically as an unaccounted floor break, and a padded delta is caught by the two-oracle collision
   classifier. *(The retro still reviews accepted contract diffs at intent level — the adversary moves
   the first cut of that review earlier, it does not replace the human heartbeat.)*
3. **Blind test.** The `blind-test-writer` — a *fresh context* — gets **only** the old and new contract
   text. It never sees the implementation or the diff; it has no Bash. (Rot guard 1: tests written
   looking at code assert what the code does.)
4. **Adjudication fork.** The runner runs the tests; for each red it dispatches the read-only
   `adjudicator` with the failing test + the contract clause as the sole arbiter: *implementation
   violates contract* → fix the implementation (test untouched); *test mistranslates a clause* → fix
   the test, citing the clause. (Rot guard 2: green-ness is never the goal of test-editing; most reds
   are impl-bugs.) A scope/jurisdiction fork cites `.reasonable/intention.md` (the oracle).
5. **Audit** (`adversarial-audit` skill), as a read-only `parallel()` leaf, escalating: **(a)**
   discriminator per enrichment (new tests must FAIL at the pre-task commit); **(b)** bidirectional
   mapping; **(c)** mutation sampling at the **vertical-slice gate**; **(d)** reverse discriminator for
   characterization clauses. Gate = **AND over all checks**. Collapses to one discriminator at the low
   floor; the **`lite` tier** drops only the iterative mutation sampling (c), keeping (a), (b), (d).

The pipeline uses `pipeline()` (**no barrier**): a fast-trapping lane is triaged the instant its chain
returns, not after the slowest lane.

## 3. Routing the typed GATE_RESULT (your core job)
When the run completes it returns exactly one tagged `GATE_RESULT` — the exhaustive seven-variant
union (DESIGN-3.0 §6/§9, `lib/frontier.mjs`'s `gateDue`). Switch on `kind` and run the matching arm —
**this replaces hand-interpreting the loop**:

| variant | routing |
|---|---|
| `goal-green` | close the goal; run the goal-gate retro roster |
| `heartbeat` | run the heartbeat retro roster |
| `batch-full` | drain the batch at a retro gate |
| `starved` | ratify pending permanence, clear the freezes |
| `blocked-human` | block for the human, in BOTH modes |
| `halt` | human durability halt |
| `budget-exhausted` | extend budget / re-plan |

`goal-green`, `heartbeat`, `batch-full`, `starved`, `blocked-human`, `halt`, and `budget-exhausted` are
genuinely **different human decisions** with different shapes — a goal completing and a starved
frontier must not masquerade as each other. Do not collapse the arms. (`blocked-human` is the
successor to the retired `blocked` variant, and fires in **both** run modes — an intent fork or a
policy/goal change is always human, never autonomous-self-ratified.)

### 3a. `budget-exhausted` — extend or re-plan
The budget-guarded loop ran out before GREEN (the common hard-slice exit, first-class on purpose).
Triage from `progress` + `lastOutcome`: **extend once** (logged; a second extension needs retro
approval) and re-launch the runner with a larger `budget.total` / **re-spec** / **spawn a spike**
(§3b) / **route a contract question** / **open a dead-end ceremony** (§4). The standard second move is
a **fresh-context retry** — re-launch the runner; it re-dispatches to a *new* implementer carrying only
the progress verdict, never the failed transcript. **Two independent budget exhaustions auto-promote to
the dead-end ceremony** (cross-context attempts are nearly independent — stronger evidence than one
agent's ten tries).

### 3b. `blocked-human` — a trap needs a human decision (the runner's BREAKING crossings)
The runner returns `blocked-human` when a trap arm hit a wall it cannot cross from inside a single run.
**Record the wall against the slice node before you triage it** — whatever `outcome.kind` turns out to
be, the slice stopped short of green, so mark that first with the wall as the reason:
`node ${reasonable}/lib/ledger.mjs append --root <effortRoot> --type node-failed --node <S> --reason '<the wall/blocker>'`.
Inspect `outcome.kind` and act:
- **`spike-needed`** → the runner cannot call `workflow()` (one-level nesting). **You launch
  `workflows/spike.workflow.js`** in a quarantine workspace. Harvest its knowledge artifact through the
  retro; the slice implementer later does **rewrite-from-knowledge**, never reads the spike code. Then
  re-launch the runner.
- **`infeasible`** (dead-end claim) → run the **dead-end ceremony** (§4): dispatch a fresh `skeptic` to
  refute before binding anything.
- **`intent-fork`** → an ambiguity neither code nor `intention.md` can settle → **human inbox
  (BREAKING)**; in gated mode block for the decision, in autonomous mode this is the one class that
  still routes to the human (it can turn on a vision/scope choice). A **vision amendment** always
  routes to the human regardless of mode. *(The contract-enrichment adversary surfaces here too: a
  re-enrichment the adversary still rejects, or an `escalate` it cannot settle against the vision +
  slice spec, returns as an `intent-fork`.)*
- **`other`** → an unknown wall the schema can't name → **human inbox (BREAKING)**; fail-safe.
- **`unforeseen-regression`** (a floor break the change did not declare via `behaviorDelta`, mechanically
  classified by `toGateResult`'s two-oracle classifier) → BREAKING; present the broken floor tests and
  block. (A *planned* supersession — declared `behaviorDelta` + a new grown test now governing the
  locus — rides along as **advisory**, batched at the retro, not blocking.)

The runner's in-run trap router already handled the **machine-to-machine** arms (`scope-expansion`
grant/inbox, `ripple` resequencing, `jurisdiction` adjudication, `checkpoint` budget triage) by
steering its own budget-guarded loop — those do not surface here. You only handle the BREAKING
crossings it returns.

### 3c. `halt` — durability / reconcile halt → human
The reconcile prologue found an **AMBIGUOUS** configuration (or the scribe could not persist the
index). Truth is intact — reconcile rebuilds the derived index from git + ledger + contracts. **Record
the halt against the slice node** before presenting it, so the tree shows exactly where the run
stopped: `node ${reasonable}/lib/ledger.mjs append --root <effortRoot> --type node-failed --node <S> --reason '<the wall/blocker>'`.
Present `reason` to the human; do **not** guess a recovery state (defaulting to a "safer" mode is a forbidden
inference). Resolve the ambiguity, then re-launch.

**The floor-integrity backstop is the fifth always-escalate class (D6 + D13).** The byte-level
floor-integrity hash cannot tell a harmless additive pin from a real regression, so it no longer
first-line HALTs — it is a **tier-3 backstop tripwire**: reconcile *surfaces* every floor change,
annotated `explained-by-verdict` (advisory) by any `accept`. But the demotion moved the floor gate
*earlier* (to the pre-integration intent-verifier), it did not remove it — so an unattended run must
still stop on a surprise regression that bypassed that adversary. **D13 — the unexplained-breach
stop:** in **autonomous** mode an **unexplained** breaking floor-integrity-mismatch (a surfaced floor
diff that **no** `accept` verdict explains — `result.floorIntegrity.unexplained > 0`) is the **fifth
always-escalate class**: reconcile sets `halt = true` (queue **BREAKING** + stop the loop), so it
returns as a `halt` here — do **not** grind on; present it and resolve before re-launch. An
**explained** floor diff (the adversary accepted it pre-integration) is a **non-blocking notice**: it
surfaces and is logged, the run continues. In **gated** mode neither halts — both just surface in the
briefing for the present human. Annotate-not-disarm holds throughout: the human always sees the diff,
explained or not; an `accept` only ever causes **more** surfacing, never less.

## 4. Spikes & dead ends (information vs. walls)
- **Mid-slice spike** (surfaced as a `blocked-human` / `spike-needed` `GATE_RESULT`): **you** launch
  `workflows/spike.workflow.js` (a `spike-runner` in a quarantine workspace) — never explore in-slice,
  and the runner cannot launch it (nesting limit). Harvest its knowledge artifact through the retro; the
  slice implementer later does **rewrite-from-knowledge**, never reads the spike code.
- **Dead end** (`infeasible`): an infeasibility claim must meet the evidence standard (approaches
  tried, binding constraint named, minimal repro). Dispatch a fresh **`skeptic`** (timeboxed) to
  refute. Only a **refutation-surviving** verdict binds → append a `verdict`/`dead-end` to the ledger
  **with the work-order hash** (the redispatch guard keys on it); the route-planner re-prices siblings.
  A bound dead end also marks the work-order **node** failed (Family 1 — you are the emitter here):
  `node ${reasonable}/lib/ledger.mjs append --root <effortRoot> --type node-failed --workOrder <woId> --reason '<binding constraint>'`
  (a later ratified redispatch reopens it as a fresh attempt; a ratified drop cancels it — never delete).
  Before re-dispatching any previously dead-ended work order, the runner's route-planner runs
  `node ${reasonable}/lib/redispatch-guard.mjs <wo-id>` — blocked unless an input changed.

## 5. Ripple resolution (what the runner sequences — escalate only the cycles)
A ripple manifest names the affected contracts/clauses and enrichment-vs-amendment per change. The
runner resolves it **inside the run** as a **topologically ordered sequence of single-contract pipeline
runs**, not one transaction (parity holds at every commit):
- **Enrichments flow provider-first** (B gains the capability through the full pipeline, then A builds
  on it).
- **Amendments flow consumer-first** (every consumer stops relying, then the provider weakens — no
  citation ever dangles; verified with `lib/citation-resolve.mjs`).
- The **vertical-slice gate umbrellas the joint result** before any merge.
- **Extraction is a ripple with a birth:** the new component is born first (contract + thin impl
  through the pipeline), then existing contracts adjust to cite it (provider-first).

What returns to **you**: a **ripple cycle (A needs B needs A) is a topology smell** — a hidden shared
concept wants extraction. The runner cannot grow new control flow to chase it, so it surfaces as a
`blocked-human` crossing (or an inbox item). Escalate to the retro; do not force it.

## 6. The approval inbox & freezes
- The runner's scribe queues interrupts (vision-amendment requests, skeptic-confirmed dead ends,
  topology smells, second budget extensions, provenance drift) into `.reasonable/inbox.json` with a
  **BREAKING / ADVISORY** class. A freeze is **footprint-scoped**: only lanes whose footprints
  intersect the affected contracts freeze; disjoint lanes run on.
- **When the run returns `blocked-human` (or every lane is frozen), stop fully and present the inbox to the
  human — BREAKING first, ADVISORY merely counted.** **No human gate is ever passed by timeout or
  absence — silence means frozen, never approved.**
- **Cross-vertical-slice parallelism** (opt-in) means more than one runner in flight. Disjoint
  footprints make it safe; an overlap is serialized. Keep one slice in flight by default — five slices
  at once spends feedback.

## 7. Close the vertical slice → retro (the `goal-green`/`heartbeat` arms)
On a `goal-green` or `heartbeat` `GATE_RESULT`, the runner has already verified the gate math internally — but you confirm
it at the membrane before merging and closing:
- **Confirm the work product is committed — land residual, then verify clean.** The runner's in-run
  `commitBlindTests` stage already lands each lane's blind-test-writer tests in a trailered commit (the
  blind-writer has no Bash to commit its own output — BUG 3, twice), so the lane tip carries module +
  tests. The merge is a membrane act you own, so belt-and-suspenders: for each lane run `node
  ${reasonable}/lib/commit-gate.mjs --root <laneWorktree> --commit "chore(reasonable): land residual
  lane work product"` (idempotent — a clean no-op when the lane is already committed; `--root
  <laneWorktree>` targets the lane, since your cwd is the main checkout), then confirm `node
  ${reasonable}/lib/commit-gate.mjs --root <laneWorktree> --check` is clean before its merge —
  "uncommitted == not done" (the commit iron rule). A lane's implementer commit **and** its blind-test
  commit are both mandatory; a green result over an uncommitted lane tree is invalid, and a naive `git
  merge` silently drops staged-but-uncommitted tests (the exact loss BUG 3 fixes).
- **Verify the gate evidence yourself.** The slice's promoted scenarios are GREEN and the
  vertical-slice-gate audit (mutation + sanity + proportionality + mapping, `adversarial-audit` skill)
  passed. The gate is the merge condition, not a vibe — re-check, don't trust the summary.
- **Merge each green lane into the EFFORT BRANCH — automatically, no per-slice escalation.** A lane
  merges **only when its gate is GREEN**, in the ripple's topological order, into `config.effortBranch`
  (which the main checkout is on for the whole effort): `git merge --no-ff lane/<wo>`. This is the
  **one default resolution applied every slice** — integrate to the effort branch — so the next slice's
  lane is cut from a branch that already contains slices 1..N. It **never escalates**: in **autonomous**
  mode it proceeds and is logged (`approvedBy:"autonomous"`); in **gated** mode the supervision profile
  governs the *nod*, but per-slice integration hygiene is not the human-integration decision — that is
  the single `effortBranch → baseBranch` merge at effort end (below). Lanes had provably **disjoint
  footprints**, so **a merge conflict between them is a footprint bug** — an under-declared locus or
  missing citation. Log it (it debugs the spec layer); fix the footprint. Record every merge SHA in the
  journal (provenance accounting; `lib/commit-accounting.mjs`). The base branch is **never written**
  here.
- **Close each merged work order's node.** The instant a lane's merge lands cleanly on the effort
  branch, its work order is actually done — repeat once per lane merged this wave:
  `node ${reasonable}/lib/ledger.mjs append --root <effortRoot> --type node-completed --workOrder <woId> --kind work-order`
- **Update the journal** (work orders `merged`; vertical slice closing) — a write you own again now the
  run has returned.
- **Open the retro node, then invoke the `retro` skill** — the mandatory blocking heartbeat. The retro
  is a node beneath its slice (the whole-effort tree has no unrecorded phases), and you drive it, so you
  emit its lifecycle (Family 1):
  `node ${reasonable}/lib/ledger.mjs append --root <effortRoot> --type node-planned --node <S>/retro --kind phase --title 'retro <S>'`
  `node ${reasonable}/lib/ledger.mjs append --root <effortRoot> --type node-dispatched --node <S>/retro --kind phase`
  The run ended **at** the retro gate, never through it; the human-blocking retro runs here, in the main
  session. Do not open the next vertical slice before the retro runs.
- **Close the retro node, then the slice node, once retro returns.** The retro is what actually settles
  the slice, so mark them done only after that heartbeat completes, not the instant the gate result
  arrived — retro child first, then its slice:
  `node ${reasonable}/lib/ledger.mjs append --root <effortRoot> --type node-completed --node <S>/retro`
  `node ${reasonable}/lib/ledger.mjs append --root <effortRoot> --type node-completed --node <S>`

## 7a. Effort end — merge the effort branch to the base (the single human gate)
Per-slice integration never reaches the base branch — green lanes accumulate on the **effort branch**
and the base stays untouched for the whole effort. The **one** integration that touches the base is the
final `effortBranch → baseBranch` merge, when the route's frontier is exhausted (no open slices) and the
last retro has passed:

```
git checkout <baseBranch>
git merge --no-ff <effortBranch>      # records the merge SHA in the journal/ledger
```

This is the **natural human review gate** — the whole effort lands as one reviewable integration. In
**gated** mode it **blocks** for the human's explicit nod (silence never consents); in **autonomous**
mode it is the single deliberate landing act — log it (and, if your run is configured to leave the
final landing to a person, stop here and present the effort branch for review rather than auto-merging
to the base). Because per-slice hygiene already integrated every slice onto the effort branch, this
merge is the *only* point integration was ever a question — and it is asked exactly once.

## Run mode and the supervision profile
Two distinct controls govern human involvement; **neither ever waives a mechanical check.**

The run **mode** — `gated` (`reasonable:develop`) or `autonomous` (`reasonable:develop-autonomously`), set at
entry, recorded in `config.json`, and passed to the runner as `args.runMode` — governs **gate-blocking
at the membrane**:
- **gated:** every ratification gate and merge waits for an explicit human nod. Silence never consents.
- **autonomous:** gates self-ratify and are logged; merges proceed (gate-protected, revertible,
  recorded). Every mechanical gate check still runs inside the runner; a vision amendment still routes
  to the human.

The supervision **profile** — `strict | standard | trusting` in `supervision.json` — is the *finer*
dial **within gated mode**: it governs how often the human is consulted for between-gate *judgment*
approvals (work-order dispatch batches, merges to the vertical-slice branch, amendment batches), not
whether gates block. The entry skill sets the initial profile (gated→`strict`, autonomous→`trusting`);
the retro tunes it. **No profile ever pre-approves mechanical evidence** — discriminator, mutation,
sanity, and mapping run regardless; `trusting` only pre-approves amendment *batches* unless flagged. In
autonomous mode the profile is largely inert (nothing waits on the human).

The **tier** — `full | lite` in `config.json`, per-slice overridable in `route.md`, passed to the
runner as `args.tier` — is the **orthogonal** axis governing per-slice **verification depth**, not human
involvement. `lite` drops only the audit's iterative mutation-sample (the §17 audit-depth collapse); it
waives no guard, is never inferred downward (an agent may only *raise* a slice to `full`), and composes
freely with either mode. Like mode/profile, changing the effort-default tier mid-effort needs an
explicit human instruction, logged.

Both modes are equally strict about the *procedure*; they differ only in whether the human is waited
on. Changing mode or profile mid-effort requires an explicit human instruction, logged.

## Common mistakes
- **Re-implementing the dispatch loop in the main session.** Launch the runner; it owns reconcile,
  routing, `groupDisjoint`, the enrichment `pipeline()`, and the trap `switch`. You route its typed
  `GATE_RESULT` and handle the membrane crossings — nothing more.
- **Co-writing the journal during the run.** The runner's lone scribe owns the derived index in flight;
  you write it only at the membrane (slice opening, merges, slice closing).
- **Treating `budget-exhausted` as a gate** (or as a failure). It is a first-class, distinct human
  decision: extend once / re-plan / spike / dead-end. Don't conflate it with `goal-green`/`heartbeat` or `blocked-human`.
- **Trying to launch a spike or scaffold from inside the runner.** One-level `workflow()` nesting
  forbids it — the runner returns `spike-needed`/`blocked-human` and *you* launch the nested workflow.
- **Letting the implementer write tests, or the test-writer see code.** Both break the verification
  chain. The runner enforces fresh blind subagents, capability-enforced.
- **Iterating tests to green.** The runner's adjudication fork rules; most reds are impl-bugs.
- **Trusting a self-authored contract enrichment because the tests pass.** Tests derive *from* the
  contract — they cannot catch a sycophantic enrichment. The contract-enrichment adversary judges the
  enrichment against the vision + slice spec *before* tests derive from it, and it always runs on a
  shared-contract touch. Don't conflate it with the auditor (which judges whether the *tests* have
  teeth) — one asks whether the contract is honest, the other whether the tests are.
- **Five vertical slices at once.** That spends feedback. One slice in flight by default.
- **Resolving a ripple as one big commit.** The runner sequences topologically ordered single-contract
  runs; parity at every commit. You only escalate the cycles.
- **Passing a human gate by timeout.** Never. Silence is frozen.
